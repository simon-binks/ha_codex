# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- Run nginx in foreground mode (`daemon off`) to prevent immediate exit

## [0.1.7] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- Use nginx reverse proxy instead of socat

## [0.1.6] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- Use socat TCP forwarder to expose CDP port externally

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- Added `--remote-debugging-bind-to-all-interfaces` flag for newer Chrome versions
