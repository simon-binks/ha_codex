# Playwright Browser Add-on

Headless Chromium browser with Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) endpoint for browser automation.

## Overview

This add-on runs a headless Chromium browser that exposes a CDP endpoint, allowing other add-ons (like Claude Code) to connect and perform browser automation tasks.

Based on the official [Microsoft Playwright Docker image](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker) (`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.50.0-noble`).

## Installation

1. Add this repository to Home Assistant
2. Install the "Playwright Browser" add-on
3. Start the add-on (it does NOT auto-start by default)
4. The CDP endpoint will be available at `ws://local-playwright-browser:9222`

## Usage with Claude Code

1. Install and start this add-on
2. In Claude Code configuration, enable "Playwright MCP"
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Claude Code will automatically connect to this browser for web automation

## Configuration

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `cdp_port` | 9222 | Port for the CDP endpoint |

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────┐     CDP WebSocket              ┌─────────────────────┐
│   Claude Code       │ ─────────────────────────────> │  Playwright Browser │
│   (Alpine, ~100MB)  │  ws://local-playwright-browser │  (Ubuntu, ~2GB)     │
│                     │           :9222                │                     │
│  @playwright/mcp    │                                │  Headless Chromium  │
└─────────────────────┘                                └─────────────────────┘
```

## Why a separate add-on?

Playwright/Chromium requires Ubuntu/Debian (glibc) to work properly. Home Assistant's default add-on base is Alpine (musl), which is incompatible with Chromium's sandbox requirements.

This add-on uses the official Playwright Docker image (Ubuntu-based) while keeping Claude Code lightweight on Alpine (~100MB vs ~2GB).

## Supported Architectures

- amd64 (x86_64)

Note: ARM64 (aarch64) support may be added in a future release once tested.

## Network

| Port | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 9222/tcp | Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) endpoint |

## Troubleshooting

**Add-on won't start?**
- Check the logs in Supervisor → Playwright Browser → Log
- Ensure you have enough disk space (~2GB for the image)

**Claude Code can't connect?**
- Make sure this add-on is running before enabling Playwright MCP in Claude Code
- Restart Claude Code after enabling Playwright MCP
